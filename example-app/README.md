# Example application

## Objective

This is an application to be built and tested by GitHub actions (see parent folder).

## Source

The application is based on the Apache-2 licensed [okta-kotlin-react-crud-example](https://github.com/oktadev/okta-kotlin-react-crud-example)

The authentication bits have been removed (by reverting to the content present in the [accompanying blog post](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/01/13/kotlin-react-crud), also available in the `demo.adoc` file)
